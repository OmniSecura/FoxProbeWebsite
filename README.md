## FoxProbe Documentation Companion
The FoxProbe documentation site is a guided workspace that mirrors the desktop console's end-to-end workflow. It walks new analysts through environment preparation, first captures, and the live toolbars that keep traffic recording responsive. Dedicated feature deep-dives explain how to pivot from packet tables into Follow Stream reconstructions, animate geo-visualizations, and annotate dashboards with shareable callouts. Automation coverage highlights anomaly detection profiles, alert routing to collaboration tools, and the plugin SDK used to extend FoxProbe with custom decoders or processors. Report Builder tutorials demonstrate how to weave executive-ready narratives from tagged evidence, metrics, and recommendations, while collaboration tips focus on sharing templates, themes, and configuration bundles across a team. A gallery of curated screenshots ties each lesson back to the UI so readers always know where to click next.
